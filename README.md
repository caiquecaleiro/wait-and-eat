# Wait and Eat
Wait and Eat replaces paper waiting lists at restaurants.

If you eat at restaurants a lot, you'll love the app because instead of waiting around for your name to be called, you'll just get a text message when a table opens up.

If you own a restaurant, you'll love the app because it makes managing waiting lists really easy, reduces no shows, and creates happier customers that are more likely to come back.

The app uses these technologies:

* AngularJS 1.5.x
* Firebase 2.2.x
* AngularFire 1.2.x
* Bootstrap 3.3.x

## Style and structure

This app follows [John Papa's AngularJS style guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide),
which is the style guide recommended by the AngularJS core team.
